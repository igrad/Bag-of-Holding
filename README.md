# Bag-of-Holding
Bag of Holding is a cross-platform mobile app for maintaining inventory in fictionalized games. This project is heavily inspired by Dungeons & Dragons' Bag of Holding item, and is intended as a small play on the well-known item in D&D groups. The app is intended for both iOS and Android platforms, and does not intend to support Windows mobile devices.

At the time of writing, there are quite a few ideas bouncing around for this project, but few of those things are set in stone. The hopeful release for this project is early 2018, depending on how these first iterations go.

This is intended to be released as a free app, with options for donations. I do not intend to use any ads for revenue, as this is fully intended to be a small contribution to the D&D community and not a source of profit for me.
