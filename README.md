# Bag-of-Holding
Bag of Holding is a cross-platform mobile app for maintaining inventory in RPG tabletop games, such as Dungeons and Dragons, Warhammer 40k, and others. This project is heavily inspired by Dungeons & Dragons' Bag of Holding item, and is intended as a small play on the well-known item. The app is intended for both iOS and Android platforms, and may support Windows mobile platforms down the road if Kivy begins to support it.

At the time of writing, there are quite a few ideas bouncing around for this project, and few of those things are set in stone. The targeted release for this project is early 2018, depending on how the first few iterations go. The projet is currently on its third visual iteration, which should hopefully be its last.

This is intended to be released as a free app, with options for donations. There will be no ads for revenue, as this is simply a small contribution to the gaming community - not my source of income.
